# Givel (wwww.givel.co)
## Everyday heroes.

### Let's inspire the world. Together.

Givel is the first social media app to celebrate the best in all of us. 
​
Imagine waking up to positive stories in your newsfeed, creating kindness 
challenges with those around the globe, and discovering the world's most 
giving organizations. That's Givel. And it's completely free to join. Always.


### Technology is awesome.

Thanks to the apps we use the most, we're more connected than ever before. 
In many ways, though, we've also become more disconnected. 
 
Using technology for good, Givel helps reconnect us to what's 
important—compassion, kindness, and positive relationships, both online 
and off. 


### One app. Kindness multiplied.

**What makes Givel different than other social media apps?**

- Givel is built around kindness, so you always have awesome stories in 
  your newsfeed without having to filter through stuff you'd rather not see.

- Posting Kindness challenges is a great way to inspire your community and 
		those around the world. Just post a challenge and watch it take off!
- Discover the organizations with the biggest hearts and help them increase
  awareness with others. And with Givel stars, it's always free!


### Human. Kind. Let's be both.

The Givel app (iOS beta) is set to launch in Spring 2017. In the meantime, 
please add your email below and join the kindness revolution. Not only 
will we think you're incredible, you'll be the first to receive updates 
on our app release.

Let's inspire the world. Together.
